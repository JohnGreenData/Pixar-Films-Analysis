Pixar Films Analysis  
Improving profitability and resilience in the modern cinema landscape

Project overview  
This project addresses the challenge of ensuring Pixar’s long-term profitability and survival as streaming services increasingly compete with traditional cinema releases. Using historical film data, I developed data-driven recommendations to support release strategy, budgeting, and risk management.

Business problem  
Pixar wanted to understand which factors contribute most to financial success, and how production and release decisions should adapt in response to streaming growth and potential global disruptions similar to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Approach
 - Analysed Pixar film data from 1995 to 2024
 - Examined financial performance, release timing, audience reception, and awards
 - Assessed profitability, risk exposure, and recovery following loss-making periods
 - Evaluated release strategies across cinema and streaming channels

Key insights
 - Budgets of $150–200m consistently maximise revenue and profit, despite not maximising box-office-to-budget ratio
 - Release timing strongly influences success, with Friday / June and Wednesday / November (US Thanksgiving) performing best
 - Pandemic-era losses were significant but recoverable through subsequent high-performing releases
 - Award wins correlate with higher revenue and do not require higher budgets

Recommendations
 - Maintain consistent budgets rather than reacting to individual under-performing films
 - Release films on Disney+ approximately three months after cinema release
 - Retain proven release day and month combinations, deviating cautiously
 - Prioritise directors with strong award-winning track records to maximise revenue

Tools and technologies
 - Excel

Outputs
 - The full stakeholder report, including analysis, visualisations, and recommendations.
